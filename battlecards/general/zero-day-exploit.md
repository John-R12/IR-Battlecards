# 📝 Battle Card – Zero-Day Exploit

## 🎯 Purpose
Guide to detect and respond to exploitation of a **previously unknown vulnerability** for which no patch yet exists.

---

## 🚨 Detection & Analysis
| Action | Description | Owner |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Monitor abnormal behavior | Watch for unusual crashes, unexplained traffic, or suspicious activity. | SOC |
| Threat intelligence correlation | Cross-check alerts with threat intel feeds for new zero-days. | IR / Security |
| Identify affected assets | Determine vulnerable systems and applications. | IR |
| Collect IoCs | Document indicators (hashes, domains, IPs) tied to suspected exploitation. | IR |

---

## 🛑 Containment
| Action | Description | Owner |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Isolate impacted systems | Disconnect compromised endpoints or servers. | IT |
| Apply temporary mitigations | Disable vulnerable services, apply workarounds. | IT / Security |
| Limit exposure | Restrict external access to vulnerable assets. | IT |

---

## 🧹 Eradication & Recovery
| Action | Description | Owner |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Apply vendor-provided mitigations | Follow security advisories for temporary fixes. | IT |
| Restore from clean backups | If compromise occurred, rebuild affected systems. | IT |
| Monitor for reinfection | Ensure exploit attempts are blocked after fixes. | SOC |

---

## 📋 Communication & Escalation
| Action | Description | Owner |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Notify management | Brief leadership and risk teams. | IR Lead |
| Vendor coordination | Engage vendor for patch/mitigation status. | IT / Security |
| External reporting | Share anonymized findings with ISACs or CERTs. | IR / Legal |

---

## 🔄 Post-Incident
| Action | Description | Owner |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Lessons learned | Document detection gaps and timeline. | IR |
| Improve monitoring | Deploy new signatures, detection rules, and telemetry. | SOC |
| Update processes | Enhance vulnerability management and patching cadence. | Security |
