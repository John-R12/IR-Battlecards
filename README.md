# 🛡️ Incident Response Battle Cards

This repository provides **Incident Response Battle Cards**:  
concise, checklist-style guides to handle common cybersecurity incidents.  
They are based on the **NIST SP 800-61r2 Computer Security Incident Handling Guide**  
and designed for operational use by SOC and IR teams.
